  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details class="faq-item" open>
    <summary>How is our EAP different from other models?</summary>
    <p>
      We know what it takes to cultivate a healthy work culture. Available via one convenient app, in person
      and by phone, making it easy for employers to provide timely access to an established,
      large and diverse network of counsellors whenever employees need help.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>What qualifications do your care counsellors have?</summary>
    <p>
      Every one of our counselling professionals has either a master’s or doctorate in psychology, clinical
      social work, marriage and family therapy, or a related mental-health field. They all hold at least
      three years’ post-master clinical experience—preferably within EAP—and a minimum of 2 500 hours of
      professional counselling practice.
